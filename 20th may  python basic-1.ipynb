    "In Python, variables are used to store and manipulate data. There are some rules and conventions to follow when creating variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Variable Name Rules:**\n",
    "   - Variable names must start with a letter (a-z, A-Z) or an underscore (_).\n",
    "   - After the initial letter, variable names can consist of letters, digits (0-9), and underscores.\n",
    "   - Variable names are case-sensitive, meaning `myVar` and `myvar` are considered different variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Reserved Words:**\n",
    "   - You cannot use Python's reserved keywords as variable names. These are words that have special meanings in the language and are used for specific purposes. For example, you cannot use `if`, `else`, `while`, `for`, `def`, `class`, `import`, `return`, etc. as variable names.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Python Naming Conventions:**\n",
    "   - Python has some naming conventions to make your code more readable and consistent. While these conventions are not strict rules, they are widely followed by the Python community.\n",
    "   - Use lowercase letters for variable names, and separate words with underscores (`snake_case`). For example: `my_variable`, `user_name`.\n",
    "   - For constants, use uppercase letters and underscores (`UPPER_CASE_WITH_UNDERSCORES`). For example: `PI`, `MAX_VALUE`.\n",
    "   - Class names should use CamelCase (capitalizing the first letter of each word, including the first one). For example: `MyClass`, `EmployeeDetails`.\n",
    "   - Leading underscores indicate that a variable is intended for internal use within a module (not meant to be accessed from outside). For example: `_private_var`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Avoid Using Single Underscore:**\n",
    "   - While using a single underscore as a variable name is allowed, it's often used to store the result of the last expression in a Python interactive session. For example: `_`, `_2`, `_result`.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Avoid Using Double Underscores at the Beginning:**\n",
    "   - Variables with names starting with double underscores (`__`) are used for name mangling in classes. It's generally a good practice to avoid using this pattern for your own variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that following these rules and conventions will make your code more readable and understandable by others, as well as by your future self."

Mutable types can be modified in-place, which might lead to unexpected changes if not handled carefully. Immutable types require creating new objects when changes are needed, which can be less efficient in terms of memory usage.\n",
